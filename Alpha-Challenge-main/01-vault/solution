# ERC-4626 Vault Vulnerability Analysis

## a) Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability in the old OpenZeppelin ERC-4626 implementation is known as the "donation attack" or "inflation attack". Here's how it works:

1. The vault holds underlying tokens and mints shares to depositors
2. An attacker can manipulate the exchange rate between shares and underlying tokens by directly transferring tokens to the vault (donation)
3. When a legitimate user attempts to deposit, the attacker can frontrun their transaction:
   - Transfer a large amount of tokens directly to the vault
   - This artificially inflates the exchange rate
   - User's deposit transaction executes with the manipulated rate, receiving fewer shares than expected
   - Attacker withdraws their "donated" tokens

Payoff calculation example:
- Initial state: 100 tokens = 100 shares (1:1 ratio)
- Attacker donates 900 tokens
- New ratio: 1000 tokens = 100 shares (10:1 ratio)
- User deposits 100 tokens expecting ~10 shares but receives only 1 share
- Attacker withdraws their 900 tokens
- User is left with 1 share worth only ~10 tokens instead of 100
